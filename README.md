## Replace Word Tool

Hi! Welcome to a passion project of mine. This app is built using TypeScript, React, and Material-UI and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

This app allows for global, one-time replacement of words within a body of text.

Other useful features:
* Visualize word frequency by providing every context in which a word appears throughout a text.
* Identify and change redundant vocabulary.
* Isolates proper nouns and spelling errors. (See example below)

## Workflow Example: Mask Identities in a Published Article

To:

"It's the best way to treat infections,” said *Henry Williams*, associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at *Darnell* University. *Williams* works with Dr. *Diamond*, one of the principal investigators in the research study.
